# Flight Data Cleaning

This repository contains Python scripts and resources for cleaning and analyzing flight data obtained from the ITA Matrix website using a web scraping script.

## Overview

The flight data scraping script scrapes flight information from the ITA Matrix website and saves it to an Excel file. However, the raw data requires cleaning and preprocessing before it can be used for analysis or visualization purposes.

## Data Cleaning Process

### 1. Data Loading
- Load the raw flight data from the Excel file generated by the scraping script.

### 2. Data Inspection
- Inspect the loaded data to understand its structure, columns, and any inconsistencies or missing values.

### 3. Data Cleaning Steps
- Convert data types: Ensure that columns are of the correct data type.
- Standardize column names: Rename columns to a consistent naming convention if necessary.
- Remove irrelevant columns: Remove any columns that are not relevant for analysis or visualization.

### 4. Data Transformation
- Perform any additional transformations required for analysis, such as calculating flight duration, extracting day of the week, etc.

### 5. Feature Engineering
- Add some extra columns with the data extracted from other columns. Such as duration in minutes, day of week, day of year, day time.

### 6. Data Export
- Export the cleaned data to a new Excel file or CSV file for further analysis and visualization.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the raw output Excel file (`AMSNYC.xlsx`) generated by the scraping script.
- `output/`: Directory containing output of the cleaning process.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
